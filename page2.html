                Having recently graduated with a Msc in Marketing from the London School of Economics, I am passionate about understanding the psychology of (consumer) choice. Having worked at some of the biggest FMCG firms as well as in an EdTech startup, I am a dynamic team worker and driven innovator.

                  <td><b>Sustainable Packaging Concepts for Procter & Gamble Shampoo brands (February 2020).</b> <br> As part of a pricing course during my MSc in Marketing at LSE, I was charged with determining how much people would be willing to pay for a new product, with a group of 4 other students. With the sustainability trend in mind, we were interested in pricing shampoo bars that would be sold by well-known brands, since they are currently a niche product. P&G was chosen because one of the key aspects of their mission statement is to protect the environment. Shampoo bars require less packaging than bottles, and can be used about 3 times as long as a standard bottle.</span></td>

These were developed in association with a creative agency, and had to be in line with the global strategy set out by the headquarters. Oftentimes, constraints were also set out by the retailer (here, Etos) regarding the products to be displayed and the inclusion of promotional elements.</span></td>

Carman’s is an established brand in Australia that focuses on health foods. After conducting an analysis of the market and of existing packaging, the package was reproduced in 3D. <br> Our goal was to challenge existing package shapes to reduce waste by taking out the plastic wrap and replacing it with a box and bio-degradable plastic. To allow for optimization of shelf space, the rice crackers and the package were made square.
